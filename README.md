# 4g-covid19-challenge
This is for UCDavis GSM COVID_19 Challenge.
We applied the sentiment analysis on twitter #StayHome trend data to understand people's emotions during self-quarantine time.

The mallet-2.0.8 need to be in the same folder with the code so that the code can run.
â€˜4G-final.pptx' is the final presentation we use.
'part1_web_scraping.ipynb' is how we web scrap and sample data for later usage.
'part2_nlp_modeling.ipynb' is how we did the Natrual Language Processing and final visualization.
